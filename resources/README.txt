Findings for test file:
Run time for linear search in milliseconds:
Pre-search: 1591749062903
Post-search: 1591749062920
Difference: 17 milliseconds
17 milliseconds = 17,000,000 nanoseconds
Run time for Quadratic search in nanoseconds:
Pre-search: 105778649050538
Post-search: 105778649158705
Difference: 108170 nanoseconds

From the data we can see the Quadratic search is far more fast than the linear search.
